## What's this ?

This is a PWA for tracking things. Originally was developed
with angular2+ but was almost impossible to keep the codebase, 
on the weight it needs to be. 

Later I discovered preact (and don't know why) I started porting
the main codebase to it.

The original application I wrote is here:
https://github.com/tmpo-io/tracks


## Future / Todo

- Add support for tracking money $$
- Add support for editing tracked events.
- Add some kind of text export to allow embed tracks to code repos.
