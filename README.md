## Changelog


+ Alpha 1.

  - Improved service worker handling


## What is this ?

This is a PWA for tracking things. Originally was developed
with angular2+ but was almost impossible to keep the codebase, 
on the weight it needs to be. 

Later I discovered preact (and don't know why) I started porting
the main codebase to it.

The original application I wrote is here:
https://github.com/tmpo-io/tracks
