# What is ?

This is a PWA for tracking things. Originally was developed
with angular2+ but was almost impossible to keep the codebase, 
on the weight it needs to be. 

Later I discovered preact (and don't know why) I started porting
the main codebase to it.

The original application I wrote is here:
